# SOLAS Text Analytics (TA) and Terminology Broker
SOLAS Text Analytics (TA) and Terminology Broker allows for enriching of XLIFF files with terminology and/or TA resources at ANY point during the localisation roundtrip. The data are included using XLIFF specific extension mechanisms and ITS 2.0 metadata categories. Enriching with Terminology and TA resources is made logically independent of the human intervention and hence compatible with a roundtrip of specialized agents participating in a single roundtrip upon the standardized exchange/messaging format. It is aware of state of the art metadata containers, is modular and allows for connecting of any third party terminology or TA providers.
 
SOLAS Text Analytics (TA) and Terminology Broker supports open standards; it is ITS 2 aware by design via the XLIFF 1.2. and XLIFF 2.0 Mapping. It is a reference implementation of the XLIFF 2.0 and ITS 2.0 standards. This component generalizes the TA and Terminology enriching capability and disconnects it from the human translation step. It can work in workflows with or without human translators. It can facilitate input of any number of conditionally available and usable TA and Terminology services.
